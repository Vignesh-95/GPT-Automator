Your voice-controlled Mac assistant. GPT Automator lets you perform tasks on your Mac using your voice. For example, opening applications, looking up restaurants, and synthesizing information.

## Requirements

* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

   ```shell
   # on Ubuntu or Debian
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

   # on Arch Linux
   sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

   # on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
   brew install ffmpeg

   # on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
   choco install ffmpeg

   # on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
   scoop install ffmpeg
   ```

## Instructions

1. Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` files.
2. Create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` file and fill in the OpenAI API key.
3. Run `python gui.py` to run the GUI and click 'Record' to say your prompt. Alternatively,
   run `python main.py [prompt]`
   to run the CLI.

## How it works

GPT Automator converts your audio input to text using OpenAI's Whisper. Then, it uses a [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) Agent to choose a set of actions, including generating AppleScript (for desktop automation) and
JavaScript (for browser automation) commands from your prompt using OpenAI's GPT-3 ("text-davinci-003"),
and then executing the resulting script.

## Example prompts

* Find the result of a calculation. Prompt: "What is 2 + 2?" -> It will write AppleScript to open up a calculator and type in 5 * 5.
* Find restaurants nearby. Prompt: "Find restaurants near me" -> It will open up Google search, read the text on the page, and say the best restaurants.
* Play a game of chess. Prompt: "Play a game of chess" -> It will open up Chess.com and start clicking around.
